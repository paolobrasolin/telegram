        # Upon receiving a message with this object, Telegram clients will remove the current custom keyboard and display the default letter-keyboard. By default, custom keyboards are displayed until a new keyboard is sent by a bot. An exception is made for one-time keyboards that are hidden immediately after the user presses a button (see ReplyKeyboardMarkup).
        #
        # @!attribute [rw] remove_keyboard
        #   @return [True] Requests clients to remove the custom keyboard (user will not be able to summon this keyboard; if you want to hide the keyboard from sight but keep it accessible, use _one_time_keyboard_ in ReplyKeyboardMarkup)
        # @!attribute [rw] selective
        #   @return [Boolean] _Optional_. Use this parameter if you want to remove the keyboard for specific users only. Targets: 1) users that are @mentioned in the _text_ of the Message object; 2) if the bot's message is a reply (has _reply_to_message_id_), sender of the original message.<br><br>_Example:_ A user votes in a poll, bot returns confirmation message in reply to the vote and removes the keyboard for that user, while still showing the keyboard with poll options to users who haven't voted yet.
